C# Practice
===========

Or if you will, C# interview questions. The goal is not just providing a
working solution, but also to start a conversation about a particular solution.


Most of the problems are in the form of NUnit tests. You can run these tests
and see them fail. Once the solution is correct the relevant tests will pass.

Some of the challenges are making the code compile. These are always in
separate projects.

Most of the problems are from somebody else, but I have some of my own as well.
