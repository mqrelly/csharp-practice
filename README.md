C# Practice
===========

Or if you will, C# interview questions. The goal is not just providing a
working solution, but also to start a conversation about a particular solution.


Most of the problems are in the form of NUnit tests. You can run these tests
and see them fail. Once the solution is correct the relevant tests will pass.

Some of the challenges are making the code compile. These are always in
separate projects.


Table of Challenges
-------------------

- Easy
  - Is a string palindrom? (Palindroms.cs)

- Medium
  - Find the longest non-trivial palindrom in a string (Palindroms.cs)
  - Reverse the digits in a given natural number (NumberReversal.cs)

- Hard
  - Determine if a maze is solvable or not (MazeRunner.cs)
  - Generate the lirics of the song '99 bottles of beer' (NinetyNineBottles/*.cs)

Most of the problems are from somebody else, but I have some of my own as well.
